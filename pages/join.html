                <h2>Want to become a member?</h2>

                <p>Go to our <a
                        href="https://njit.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/wjtb" target="_blank">Highlander Hub</a> to
                    request membership. Membership is extended to every NJIT student, regardless of major or class.
                    Non-students can still enjoy associative membership, but cannot host their own shows.</p>
                <p>After you've submitted your application on Highlander Hub, join us on our <a
                        href="https://wjtb.njit.edu/discord" target="_blank">discord!</a> This is where you'll
                    find all of our members and be able to reach out to us if you need anything.</p>
                <h2>Why Join?</h2>
                <p>There are a ton of reasons to join WJTB! Not every member needs to have a show, but every member
                    <i>can</i> have a show, assuming time permits and they agree to a few basic rules. Members get access
                    to the club space, our recording room, members-only events, trainings, studio time, and more!
                </p>
                <h2>Want air time?</h2>
                <p>Every semester we open up time slots to active members of WJTB. Time slots are first reserved for
                    Executive Board, Senior DJs, and other student organizations. The remaining time slots operate on a
                    first-come, first-served basis.</p>
                <p>All DJs have to follow some basic rules for airtime. To learn more, read our <a
                        href="./docs/WJTB_Gen_Member_Contract_2022.pdf" target="_blank">General Member Contract</a>.
                    <!--LINK TO RULES/REGS PDF-->
                </p>
                <p>To apply for air time, you'll need to fill out a form. Ready to get heard? Fill out the <a onclick="loadShowRequest()">form</a> today!</p>
