      <h2>Want a show, but can't commit every week?</h2>
      <p>That's why Variety Hour exists. In order to host a show, you do need to be a member.</p>
      <p>Once you're a member, you can head over to <a href="https://calendly.com/wjtbradio/variety-hour-host" target="_blank">this link</a> to book a time! If you see it, book it. </p>
      <p>If you book a show but are not trained - you will be required to be trained first (it takes 10 minutes). Otherwise, your show will be canceled. </p>
