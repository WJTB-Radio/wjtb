          <p>WJTB's roots began in the fall of 1966 as a broadcasting club for Newark College of
            Engineering - the precursor to NJIT. Before being officially assigned the call letters WNCE, the club was
            simply NCE Broadcasting. The club, founded by NJIT alumni Ted Schober, met a need that the college had yet
            to provide &mdash; A way to connect students with culture, music, and hard to find albums. <br><br>

            By 1967 the club was able to begin broadcasting over the AM airwaves from a
            radio tower on top of the nearby high school, Central High School &mdash; now the Central King Building on
            NJIT's campus. <br><br>

            When they began, they operated out of a small room on top right at the top of the Weston Hall staircase. By
            1967 the club had outgrown their room and found a new home in Colton Hall, again at the top of the
            staircase, next to the School of Architecture.

      <h2>Digital Only</h2>
      <p>Nobody can figure out exactly why WJTB stopped broadcasting on the radio waves. There are, of course, rumors. A
        history of trouble making by members, the natural curiosity that plagues all STEM students, and the
        rambunctioness that comes with city living all lend credibility to even the wildest of rumors. Did WJTB storm
        Newark Airport with a rager? Maybe. Did WJTB try to tap into the train tracks to draw more electricity to
        increase our amplification? It's possible. Did WJTB just forget to renew our license? Yeah, that sounds like us.
        Is it possible that NJIT just really didn't trust us to not be vulgar over the air? I mean... It's not unlike
        our members.</p>
      <p>The point is -- nobody knows for sure why or how we lost our ability to broadcast over the air. What <i>is</i>
        certain is that around 1997-1998, WJTB started broadcasting online. That makes this radio station not only one
        of the longest internet radio stations, but one of the raddest.</p>
