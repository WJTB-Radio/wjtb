      <h2>Streaming Live since the 1990s!</h2>

      <p>WJTB is NJIT's official college radio station - since before NJIT existed!</p>
      <p>WJTB is an undergraduate student organization at the New Jersey Institute of Technology
        focused on broadcasting radio shows, DJing live events, and providing audio recording services for our members.
        Every semester our schedule is filled with programming developed by the student members of the org.</p>
      <p></p>

      <h2>Want a show?</h2>
      <p>Awesome &mdash; we love to hear it. All DJs must be active members of the club, get trained, and follow our rules of broadcast.</p>
      <p>The fall schedule is set - so look here in the future to apply for Spring's schedule!</p>
